# Light Base Color Negative Preset
# Optimized for film with very light orange/yellow base (RGB base ~0.7-0.95)
#
# This preset is ideal for:
# - Thin or light-density negatives
# - Film stocks with minimal orange mask
# - Overexposed or bleached film
# - C-41 process with reduced development
#
# Test results:
# - raw0002: Score 0.9910, Base [0.934, 0.928, 0.701]
# NOTE: This film type requires additional parameter tuning

name: "Light Base Color Negative"

# Base offsets (R, G, B) - may need manual adjustment
base_offsets: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]

# Color correction matrix (3x3)
# Gentler adjustments for lighter base with less orange mask
color_matrix:
  - [1.05, 0.00, -0.05]  # Red: gentle boost
  - [0.00, 1.03, -0.02]  # Green: minimal adjustment
  - [-0.05, -0.02, 1.08]  # Blue: moderate boost

# Tone curve parameters
tone_curve:
  curve_type: "s-curve"
  strength: 0.40  # Gentler curve to preserve limited density range
  params: {}

# Notes about this preset
notes: |
  Optimized for color negatives with very light film base.

  ⚠ WARNING: Light bases are challenging and may require manual tuning.

  RECOMMENDED SETTINGS:
  - enable_auto_levels: true
  - auto_levels_clip_percent: 0.5-2.0 (try different values)
  - enable_auto_color: true (may help with color balance)
  - base_brightest_percent: 15.0-20.0 (wider sampling)
  - base_sampling_mode: Mean (less sensitive to outliers)
  - exposure_compensation: 1.2-1.5 (may need boost)

  CHARACTERISTICS:
  - Film base RGB typically 0.7-0.95 range
  - Weak or minimal orange mask
  - Limited density range
  - May have exposure/processing issues

  USAGE:
    positize convert input.tif --preset profiles/film/light-base-negative.yml

  TROUBLESHOOTING:
  If results are too dark (exposure ratio < 0.8):
  1. Increase exposure_compensation to 1.3-1.5
  2. Try clip_percent of 2.0-5.0 for more aggressive stretching
  3. Consider manual base ROI selection if auto-detection fails

  Light bases often indicate overexposure, thin film, or faded negatives.
  Manual intervention may be necessary for optimal results.
