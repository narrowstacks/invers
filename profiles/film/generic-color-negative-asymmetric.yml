# Generic Color Negative Film Preset with Asymmetric Curve
# Uses film-like separate toe (shadow) and shoulder (highlight) curves
#
# This preset provides more film-like tonal response than symmetric S-curves
# because real film has different response characteristics in shadows vs highlights.

name: "Generic Color Negative (Asymmetric)"

# Base offsets (R, G, B) - none, rely on base estimation
base_offsets: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]

# Color correction matrix (3x3)
# Identity matrix with slight adjustment for typical orange mask
color_matrix:
  - [1.10, -0.02, -0.08]  # Red: slight boost
  - [-0.02, 1.05, -0.03]  # Green: minimal adjustment
  - [-0.08, -0.03, 1.15]  # Blue: boost to counteract orange

# Notes about this preset
notes: |
  Generic color negative preset using asymmetric tone curves.

  The asymmetric curve provides:
  - Toe region (shadows): Gentle lift using gamma < 1
  - Mid region: Linear passthrough for natural midtones
  - Shoulder region: Soft highlight compression

  This more closely mimics real film response than symmetric S-curves.

  Adjust toe_strength/shoulder_strength for different film stocks:
  - Higher toe_strength: More shadow detail (good for underexposed)
  - Higher shoulder_strength: More highlight recovery (good for overexposed)

  Usage:
    invers convert input.tif --preset profiles/film/generic-color-negative-asymmetric.yml
